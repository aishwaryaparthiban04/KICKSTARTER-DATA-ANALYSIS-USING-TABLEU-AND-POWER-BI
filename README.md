# KICKSTARTER-DATA-ANALYSIS-USING-TABLEU-AND-POWER-BI

Kickstarter is a very helpful crowdfunding platform for entrepreneurs who are looking for a way to launch campaigns and helps them bring their creative projects to life. This is a place where anyone can broadcast their individual creative ideas, although not every one of them is able to gather enough pledges before the deadline. Therefore, it is necessary that the presenter uses creative ideas to bring out their projects which would be able to gather enough pledges and then can be counted as a successful project (Chen et al., 2013). Kickstarter is originally an internet service where people can raise money for their projects or ideas for start-ups through crowdfunding. The condition for gathering the resources as crowdfunding is that the campaign set by the person must meet its target by the set deadline before its date of publishing. 

In this experiment, a model is created for the prediction of success factors required for a Kickstarter project which would make the campaign successful, and suitable crowdfunding can be gathered for the idea. Since publishing the campaigns to achieve success is not that easy due to a large number of campaigns. Therefore, this model will predict the factors required for making a project successful. With the help and guidance provided through these factors, it will be beneficial for investors and campaigners to publish their projects in a way that will persuade investors to invest in the campaign.

**Data**

The Kickstarter dataset is taken from the Kaggle website (Kantharia,2021). This dataset provides information regarding the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns and projects from 2014 to 2020 and can be used for creating a model to predict the success rate of the Kickstarter campaign. Originally the author has collected the dataset from webrobots.io and perform data pre-processing techniques to clean it. The data dictionary below shows the information of the features names, description, and the type of data.

**Persona and Questions**

The user is an Angel investor who actively invests in the early-stage start-ups through their social network. Now the investor wants to know about the crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter. He is particularly interested in understanding how the subcategories and backers count contribute to the success of a Kickstarter project. They have two specific questions: 
1.	What is the success rate of the Kickstarter project in each subcategory, and what is the overall status?
2.	What is the average backer count per country, and in which year most of the Kickstarter projects were successful?
